# Arduino RFID-Based Windows Login System

This project demonstrates an Arduino-based secure Windows login system using an RFID module (MFRC522) and the Arduino Keyboard library. It replaces traditional login methods with a swipe-based system. When an authorized RFID tag is scanned, the Arduino enters a pre-defined password and logs in automatically. When the tag is removed, it triggers the Windows lock command to secure the computer. 

### Features:
- **RFID Authentication**: Only a specified RFID tag can log in.
- **Automatic Login**: The system enters the password and submits it.
- **Auto-Lock**: Automatically locks the computer when the tag is removed.

This solution is ideal for workplaces requiring enhanced access control with simple setup and operation.
